I am a student in the Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIST) program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. This is a one-year M.S. program from which I expect to graduate after a capstone internship in Summer 2025. I am studying topics including web- and desktop-based GIS software, spatial analysis with vector and raster data, cartography principles, remote sensing, image correction and interpretation, spatial databases and queries, and extract-transform-load workflows. I am interested in using the knowledge I gain in these topics to address questions in environmental studies and plant and wildlife ecology.


At UMass, I am building upon my studies at Middlebury College, from which I graduated in May 2024 with a B.A. in Conservation Biology. At Middlebury, I was fortunate to be able to take many courses in the Geography department, including several which engaged me in GIS. I learned about the principles of open source GIS, remote sensing, and cartography, the value of a workflow-based approach for geospatial solutions, and the ways in which spatial analysis addresses important questions in the environmental sector.


I strive to use what I have learned about GIS and remote sensing at both of these institutions at a full-time geospatial position in Fall 2025.
