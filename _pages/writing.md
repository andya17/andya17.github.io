## Massachusetts Climate Action Plans Report   
This paper is the product of an elective senior independent study I completed at Middlebury College in Fall 2023. I was advised by Professor Christopher M.

## Conservation Biology Research Report  
This paper is an independent project I completed in Spring 2022 for the Middlebury College course Conservation Biology. The report concerns developing a list of important plant and animal species for a particular protected area in Trinidad and Tobago. Composing the paper required detailed literature searches and communication with the government of Trinidad and Tobago to receive additional information.

## Species Range Mapping Guide  
This is an individual assignment I completed in Spring 2024 for the Environmental Studies senior capstone course at Middlebury College. As part of a semester-long group project with three other students to assist the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department, I created a set of maps on ArcGIS Online showing the relationship between species occurrence points and natural communities, a classification system for habitat types administered by the state of Vermont. The below document is a guide to create such a map for a non-technical audience.
