## Trinidad and Tobago Indicator Species Report  
I completed this independent project for the Middlebury College course Conservation Biology. For the report, I consulted the scientific literature to develop a list of important plant and animal species for a particular protected area in Trinidad and Tobago. Composing the paper required detailed literature searches of hundreds of papers as well as communication with the government of Trinidad and Tobago to receive additional information.

## Ecological Restoration Case Studies StoryMap  
I identified and summarized 19 successful case studies of ecological restoration as part of a 2023 internship with environmental consultant [Betsy Taylor](https://www.betsytaylor.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, formerly of Breakthrough Strategies and Solutions. I then created an ArcGIS StoryMap to show the case studies in an embedded map. Ms. Taylor herself wrote the introduction to the StoryMap. This document is named on Ms. Taylor's website as representing her "Ecological Restoration Initiative".

## Massachusetts Climate Action Plans Report   
This paper is the product of an elective senior independent study I completed at Middlebury College in Fall 2023. I was advised by Professor Christopher M. Klyza of the Environmental Studies and Political Science departments. In the report, I consider how various Massachusetts communities have included environmental justice principles in their Climate Action Plan documents, which serve to detail municipal climate goals.

## Species Range Mapping Non-technical Guide 
I completed this individual assignment in Spring 2024 for the Environmental Studies senior capstone course at Middlebury College. As part of a semester-long group project with three other students to assist the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department, I created a set of maps on ArcGIS Online showing the relationship between species occurrence points and natural communities, a classification system for habitat types administered by the state of Vermont. The below document is a guide to create such a map for a non-technical audience.
