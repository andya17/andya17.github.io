# WebGIS Portfolio

The following is a digital portfolio assignment created for the course GEOG 693: WebGIS, in which I was enrolled during the Spring 2025 semester. Students were tasked with choosing three strong assignments from the course and were encouraged to add interactive elements such as pop-ups.

## Product 1: Invasive Species and Areas of Critical Environmental Concern

<b>Platform:</b> ArcGIS Online  
<b>Modification of:</b> Production Assignment 2: Data Configuration  
<b>Original feedback:</b> *I received no TA feedback on this assignment after my original submission.*

<b>Description:</b> This product is a web app created in ArcGIS Online Experience Builder. 

<b>Improvements made:</b>  
* The Production Assignment on which this product is based was constructed using ArcGIS Instant Apps, which was the Esri-created web app tool students interacted with in the early weeks of class. I expanded the features of the web app by instead creating an app in Experience Builder.


## Product 2: Pioneer Valley Invasive Species Survey
