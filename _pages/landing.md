My name is Andy Atallah, and I recently earned a Master of Science in Geographic Information Science and Technology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I have experience with GIS from both this program and from my time at Middlebury College, where I enrolled in many Geography courses while completing my Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies and Biology.

Here, on my portfolio website, you can find samples of [GIS projects](https://andya17.github.io/gis/) I have completed for supervisors, professors, and clients. You can also view the most recent version of my [resume](https://andya17.github.io/resume/).

Some recent projects I have worked on include the following: 
- A public-facing ArcGIS Experience Builder [application](https://andya17.github.io/gis/#northeast-us-salt-marsh-tax-parcel-blue-carbon-viewer){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} showing an estimated carbon sequestration rate in 40,000 tax parcels containing salt marsh from New York to Maine;
- An R [project](https://andya17.github.io/gis/#species-distribution-modeling-for-an-invasive-plant){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to produce species distribution models of an invasive plant using maximum entropy modeling;
- A [recreation](https://andya17.github.io/gis/#umass-campus-topographic-map-replication){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} of a topographic map of the UMass Amherst campus, completed from scratch, now used in an introductory Geology course at the University.

Please browse to the [GIS Projects page](https://andya17.github.io/gis/) to view all projects. 

I am eager to put my mapping skills to work in a position in the geospatial and/or environmetal sectors. I welcome contact at my personal email, aatallah101@gmail.com.
