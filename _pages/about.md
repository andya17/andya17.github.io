I have completed all requirements for the **Master of Science in Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIST)** at the **University of Massachusetts Amherst**. Throughout the program, I learned and applied advanced GIS concepts and completed a practicum in which I served as the geospatial intern for the Massachusetts Geological Survey. I remain on contract with that internship until August 30, 2025, after which point I hope to obtain a full-time position in the geospatial and/or environmental fields. I am happy to relocate.

Before attending UMass, I benefited greatly from completing GIS courses at my undergraduate alma mater, **Middlebury College**. From both Middlebury and UMass, I have gained experience with topics applicable from the start to the end of a geospatial project. My skills include:
* obtaining data from the field, an open data portal, or professional contacts
* cleaning, wrangling, and analyzing data using R or SQL
* creating extract-transform-load workflows for data interoperability
* managing projection systems to ensure compatibility
* scripting using Python to automate repetitive tasks
* executing spatial analysis with vector and raster data in ArcGIS Pro
* sharing a desktop project to the web and configuring an ArcGIS Online web application for public use
* employing the principles of cartography and graphic design, including the use of Adobe products
* maintaining extensive documentation on project steps to share with team members
