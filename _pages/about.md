I am a student in the Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIST) program at University of Massachusetts Amherst. This is a one-year M.S. program from which I expect to graduate after a capstone internship in Summer 2025. At UMass, I am studying such topics as remote sensing, image interpretation, spatial analysis with vector and raster data, spatial databases, data interoperability, automated workflows, and web- and desktop-based GIS. I am particularly interested in the fields of environmental science and plant and wildlife ecology.

I am building upon work I completed at Middlebury College, from which I graduated in May 2024 with a B.A. in Conservation Biology. At Middlebury, I was fortunate to be able to take many courses in the Geography department, including several which engaged me in GIS. I learned about the principles of open source GIS, remote sensing, and cartography, the value of coding and a workflow-based approach for geospatial solutions, and how spatial analysis could address important questions in the fields of environmental studies and ecology.

I strive to use what I have learned about GIS and remote sensing at both of these institutions to benefit the environment at a full-time position in Fall 2025.
