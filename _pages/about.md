I am a graduate student in the final semester of the Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIST) master's program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My courses will be completed by May 16, 2025. At UMass Amherst, I am studying topics such as:
* desktop- and web-based GIS
* GIS programming
* spatial analysis with vector and raster data
* cartographic principles
* remote sensing and image correction/interpretation
* spatial databases and queries 
* extract-transform-load workflows

At UMass, I am building upon my studies at Middlebury College, from which I graduated in May 2024 with a B.A. in Conservation Biology. At Middlebury, I was fortunate to be able to take many courses in the Geography department, including several which engaged me in GIS. I learned about the principles of open source GIS, remote sensing, and cartography, the value of a workflow-based approach for geospatial solutions, and the ways in which spatial analysis addresses important questions in the environmental sector.

I strive to use what I have learned about GIS and remote sensing at both of these institutions at a full-time geospatial position after my courses conclude in May 2025.
