## API-Driven Species Mapping Dashboard
For the University of Massachusetts Amherst course Spatial Databases and Data Interoperability, I used FME to query the API of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and create an ArcGIS Dashboard to display species occurrence points alongside particular habitat polygons. This was the final project for this Fall 2024 course.

## Wildlife Corridor Reproduction Study  
I completed the following project with a classmate in the Middlebury College course Open GIScience in Fall 2023. Using the software R, we attempted to reproduce the steps of a QGIS model which produced a least cost surface for an area in Tanzania. We used packages such as `raster`, `stars`, and `tmap` to create an analogous workflow to that of the QGIS model. I provided CRediT roles to reflect the balance of work between the two contributors at the conclusion of the report linked below.

## Climate-based Invasive Species Distribution Model
For the University of Massachusetts Amherst course Introduction to GIS (Fall 2024), I worked with point data for the plant English Ivy, invasive in some U.S. states, to predict the future distribution of the species in the United States and Canada with forecasted shifts in climatic variables.

## Green Needham "Tap Map"  
In Summer 2024, I created a web map showing the locations of water fountains and water bottle filling stations in Needham, Massachusetts for the community environmental organization Green Needham. To construct the map, I collected coordinates of water fountains both outdoors and inside public buildings. I then used the 
WordPress plugin WP Go Maps to create point data.

## Vermont Forested Habitat Block Report   
This is a report I composed for the Middlebury College course Conservation Planning in Spring 2023. It involves adding to a forested habitat block model created by instructor Dr. Jeff Howarth to allow for natural communities, a classification system for habitat types administered by the state of Vermont, to be captured in the model. I used Google Earth Engine and WhiteboxTools to achieve the results.

## Ecological Restoration Case Studies StoryMap  
I created an ArcGIS StoryMap in 2023 as part of an internship with environmental consultant Betsy Taylor, formerly of Breakthrough Strategies and Solutions. An embedded map shows the locations of 19 successful case studies of ecological restoration. I identified and summarized the selected case studies with the advisory of Ms. Taylor, who herself wrote the introduction to the StoryMap. This document is named on Ms. Taylor's website as representing her "Ecological Restoration Initiative".
