## Species Distribution Model Project

For the University of Massachusetts Amherst course Introduction to GIS, I worked with point data for the plant English Ivy, invasive in some U.S. states, to predict the future distribution of the species in the United States and Canada with forecasted shifts in climatic variables.

## Wildlife Corridor Reproduction Study  
I completed the following project with a classmate in the Middlebury College course Open GIScience in Fall 2023. We attempted to reproduce the steps of a QGIS model which produced a least cost surface by instead using the software R. We used packages such as `raster`, `stars`, and `tmap` to create an analogous workflow to that of the QGIS model. I provided CRediT roles to reflect the balance of work between the contributors at the conclusion of the report linked below.

## Green Needham "Tap Map"  
In Summer 2024, I created a web map showing the locations of water fountains and water bottle filling stations in Needham, Massachusetts for the community environmental organization Green Needham. This work involved taking coordinates in the field and inside public buildings and using the WordPress plugin WP Go Maps to construct the map.

## Ecological Restoration StoryMap  
I created an ArcGIS StoryMap in 2023 as part of an internship with environmental consultant Betsy Taylor, formerly of Breakthrough Strategies and Solutions. An embedded map shows the locations of 19 successful case studies of ecological restoration. I identified and summarized the selected case studies with the advisory of Ms. Taylor, who herself wrote the introduction to the StoryMap. This document is named on Ms. Taylor's website as representing her "Ecological Restoration Initiative".

## Forested Habitat Block Report   
This is a report I composed for the Middlebury College course Conservation Planning in Spring 2023. It involves adding to a forested habitat block model created by instructor Dr. Jeff Howarth to allow for natural communities, a classification system for habitat types administered by the state of Vermont, to be captured in the model. I used Google Earth Engine and WhiteboxTools to achieve the results.

## Flood Hazard Area Natural Habitat Report  
In the following report for the Middlebury College course Conservation Planning, I write about a Google Earth Engine model which calculates the amount of natural habitat in the FEMA Special Flood Hazard Area in Middlebury, Vermont. The report concerns how small variations in model parameters, such as scale, can have impacts on the outputs.
