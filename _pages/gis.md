## Current Project  
### Massachusetts Geological Survey Salt Marsh Blue Carbon Viewer
<img src="https://andya17.github.io/assets/GitHub-Picture-BCViewer-Short.png" alt="">   
As a Graduate Research Assistant under Massachusetts State Geologist Brian Yellen in early 2025, I developed a web application on ArcGIS Online which shows a calculated estimate for carbon sequestration in each Massachusetts tax parcel containing salt marsh. Calculations for carbon sequestration are based on spatial analysis I executed in ArcGIS Pro. The draft app underwent review by state personnel, and I am now tasked with expanding the app to cover the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey. The app is intended to be public-facing once this update is complete.

I will share a link to the application once it has been finished.

## Completed Projects
### Species Distribution Modeling in R
For the UMass Amherst course Spatial Data Analysis in R, I completed a current and future species distribution model for the invasive plant species tree-of-heaven. In this Spring 2025 project, I explored my interest in mapping invasive plants, which I recognize as being important targets for non-profit and governmental land management agencies. I was excited to include methods to remotely download necessary data to alleviate the need for manual updates in the future.

### API-Driven Species Mapping Dashboard
<img src="https://andya17.github.io/assets/GitHub-Picture-API-Short.png" alt="">   
For the UMass Amherst course Spatial Databases and Data Interoperability, I used Feature Manipulation Engine (FME) to query the API of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and create an ArcGIS Dashboard to display species occurrence points alongside particular habitat polygons. This was the final project for this Fall 2024 course. This project was intended to improve the workflow for creating similar maps, which formed part of my work in a Middlebury College course (see section Small Mammal Species Range Dashboard).

### Wildlife Corridor Reproduction Study  
<img src="https://andya17.github.io/assets/GitHub-Picture-WildlifeCorridor-Short.png" alt="">   
I completed the following project with a classmate in the Middlebury College course Open GIScience during the Fall 2023 semester. Using the software R, we attempted to reproduce the steps of a QGIS model which produced a least cost surface for an area in Tanzania. We used packages such as `stars`, `raster`, and `tmap` to create an analogous workflow to that of the QGIS model. I provided CRediT roles to reflect the balance of work between the two contributors at the conclusion of the report linked below.

### International Association for the Study of the Commons Web Map  
<img src="https://andya17.github.io/assets/GitHub-Picture-IASC-Short.png" alt="">  
As a project for Dr. Charles Schweik, professor at UMass Amherst, I developed a web application to help attendees navigate campus during the International Association for the Study of the Commons [20th Biennial Conference](https://2025.iasc-commons.org/), held on campus in June 2025. Creating the app involved georeferencing floor plans of campus buildings at which conference presentations were held within ArcGIS Pro. Throughout the conference, which attracted hundreds of attendees from across the world, my application served as the navigational tool for newcomers to campus.

Access the web application at [this link](https://umass-amherst.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/basic/index.html?appid=e2b2dc8999784c77b089e4c659c81101){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

### Small Mammal Species Range Dashboard
<img src="https://andya17.github.io/assets/GitHub-Picture-SmallMammal-Short.png" alt="">   
For the capstone requirement for the Environmental Studies major at Middlebury College, I was part of a four-person group to assist the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department in gathering information on small mammals and mesocarnivores for the upcoming 2025 update to the state Wildlife Action Plan. Within my group, I was personally responsible for the creation of 17 public-facing ArcGIS web maps. Each web map displays data on one mammal species from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and, where applicable, the natural history collections at the University of Vermont. From personal communication with instructor Dr. Alexis Mychajliw, the Mammal Scientific Adivsory Group subsequently used the maps to help update the mammal sections in the forthcoming Wildlife Action Plan update.

Note that the first map may initially take time to load â€“ the user can expedite loading by zooming into the map element (the large rectangle, if it is not loading) and waiting for a short period of time.  

### Topographic Map Replication
In February 2025, I took on a project to update a topographic map of the UMass Amherst campus for use in the class materials of an introductory Geology course. The professor provided me with a map printed on physical media with no online sources. I used LiDAR, road, and building data within ArcGIS Pro to replicate the extent and style of the reference map while ensuring that contour line features reflected more current topography. The professor, Dr. William Clement, plans to use the new map in his course during the Spring 2025 semester.

### Vermont Forested Habitat Block Report   
I composed this report for the Middlebury College course Conservation Planning in Spring 2023. It involves adding to a forested habitat block model created by instructor Dr. Jeff Howarth to allow for natural communities, a classification system for habitat types administered by the state of Vermont, to be captured in the model. I composed this report with the intent for the methodology to be accessible to those without prior experience with GIS. I used Google Earth Engine and WhiteboxTools to achieve the results.

### Green Needham "Tap Map"  
<img src="https://andya17.github.io/assets/GitHub-Picture-TapMap-Short.png" alt="">   
In August and September of 2024, I created a web map showing the locations of water fountains and water bottle filling stations in Needham, Massachusetts for the community environmental organization Green Needham. To construct the map, I collected coordinates of water fountains both outdoors and inside public buildings. I then used the WordPress plugin WP Go Maps to create point data.
