## Least Cost Surface Reproduction Study  
I completed the following project with a classmate in the Middlebury College course Open GIScience in Fall 2023. We attempted to reproduce a least cost raster output from QGIS in R through the use of spatial analysis packages such as `raster`, `stars`, and `tmap`. I provided CRediT roles to reflect the balance of work between the contributors at the conclusion of the report linked below.

## Forested Habitat Block Model Report   
This is a report I composed for the Middlebury College course Conservation Planning in Spring 2023. It involves adding to a forested habitat block model created by instructor Dr. Jeff Howarth to allow for natural communities to be captured in the area of the habitat blocks. I used Google Earth Engine and WhiteboxTools to achieve the results.
