## Least Cost Surface Reproduction Study  
I completed the following project with a classmate in the Middlebury College course Open GIScience in Fall 2023. We attempted to reproduce a least cost raster output from QGIS in R through the use of spatial analysis packages such as `raster`, `stars`, and `tmap`. I provided CRediT roles to reflect the balance of work between the contributors at the conclusion of the report linked below.

## Green Needham "Tap Map"  
I created a web map showing the locations of water fountains and water bottle filling stations in Needham, Massachusetts for the community environmental organization Green Needham. This work involved taking coordinates in the field and inside public buildings and using the WordPress plugin WP Go Maps to construct the map.

## Ecological Restoration StoryMap  
I created an ArcGIS StoryMap as part of an internship with experienced environmental consultant Betsy Taylor, formerly of Breakthrough Strategies and Solutions. The embedded map shows the locations of 19 successful case studies of ecological restoration. I identified and summarized the selected case studies with the advisory of Ms. Taylor, who herself wrote the introduction to the StoryMap. This document is linked on Ms. Taylor's website as representing her "Ecological Restoration Initiative".

## Forested Habitat Block Report   
This is a report I composed for the Middlebury College course Conservation Planning in Spring 2023. It involves adding to a forested habitat block model created by instructor Dr. Jeff Howarth to allow for natural communities to be captured in the model. I used Google Earth Engine and WhiteboxTools to achieve the results.

## Flood Hazard Area Natural Habitat Report  
In the following report for the Middlebury College course Conservation Planning, I write about a Google Earth Engine model which calculates the amount of natural habitat in the Special Flood Hazard Area in Middlebury, Vermont. Much of the report concerns my evaluations of whether small changes in model parameters altered the workflow.
