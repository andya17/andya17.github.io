## API-Driven Species Mapping Dashboard
For the University of Massachusetts Amherst course Spatial Databases and Data Interoperability, I used FME to query the API of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and create an ArcGIS Dashboard to display species occurrence points alongside particular habitat polygons. This was the final project for this Fall 2024 course.

## Wildlife Corridor Reproduction Study  
I completed the following project with a classmate in the Middlebury College course Open GIScience during the Fall 2023 semester. Using the software R, we attempted to reproduce the steps of a QGIS model which produced a least cost surface for an area in Tanzania. We used packages such as `stars`, `raster`, and `tmap` to create an analogous workflow to that of the QGIS model. I provided CRediT roles to reflect the balance of work between the two contributors at the conclusion of the report linked below.

## Topographic Map Replication
In February 2025, I took on a project to update a topographic map of the UMass Amherst campus for use in the class materials of an introductory Geology course. The professor provided me with a map printed on physical media with no online sources. I used LiDAR, road, and building data within ArcGIS Pro to replicate the extent and style of the reference map while ensuring that contour line features reflected more current topography. The professor, Dr. William Clement, plans to use the new map in his course during the Spring 2025 semester.

## Climate-based Invasive Species Distribution Model
For the UMass Amherst course Introduction to GIS (Fall 2024), I worked with point data for the plant English Ivy, invasive in some U.S. states, to predict the future distribution of the species in the United States and Canada with forecasted shifts in climatic variables.

## Green Needham "Tap Map"  
In August and September of 2024, I created a web map showing the locations of water fountains and water bottle filling stations in Needham, Massachusetts for the community environmental organization Green Needham. To construct the map, I collected coordinates of water fountains both outdoors and inside public buildings. I then used the WordPress plugin WP Go Maps to create point data.

## Vermont Forested Habitat Block Report   
This is a report I composed for the Middlebury College course Conservation Planning in Spring 2023. It involves adding to a forested habitat block model created by instructor Dr. Jeff Howarth to allow for natural communities, a classification system for habitat types administered by the state of Vermont, to be captured in the model. I composed this report with the intent for the methodology to be accessible to those without prior experience with GIS. I used Google Earth Engine and WhiteboxTools to achieve the results.

## Ecological Restoration Case Studies StoryMap  
I created an ArcGIS StoryMap in 2023 as part of an internship with environmental consultant Betsy Taylor, formerly of Breakthrough Strategies and Solutions. An embedded map shows the locations of 19 successful case studies of ecological restoration. I identified and summarized the selected case studies with the advisory of Ms. Taylor, who herself wrote the introduction to the StoryMap. This document is named on Ms. Taylor's website as representing her "Ecological Restoration Initiative".
